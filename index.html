            <p>Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Honey's longevity lies in its unique composition, which makes it inhospitable to bacteria and microorganisms.</p>

            <p>Octopuses are remarkable creatures. They have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third heart sends it to the rest of the body. And their blood is blue because it's copper-based, which is more efficient in cold and low-oxygen environments.</p>

            <p>Did you know that bananas are berries, but strawberries are not? In botanical terms, a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower with seeds embedded in the flesh. By this definition, bananas qualify as berries, but strawberries do not since they are derived from a flower with multiple ovaries</p>
